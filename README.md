## FRF-Analysis
### This software
This software records and provides graphical analysis tools for the data collected by a monitor on an experimental Airbus tank. The FRF (Frequency Response Function) is a function which quantifies the response of an actuator (driven by a white noise generator) integrated with the experimental tank in the frequency domain. The FRF Surf (Surface) plot generates a 3-dimensional graph which allows the user to visualize the shfting modes associated with the changing levels in a fuel tank. 
### General Usage 
The usage of this code implies that the user has MATLAB installed.

This image provides an overhead view of the Surf plot to help the user get an idea of how the modes of a tank shift relative to the changing levels of fuel within a tank.
