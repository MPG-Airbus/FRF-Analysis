## FRF-Analysis
### This software
This software records the data coming from a monitor on an experimental Airbus tank. The FRF Analysis (Frequency Response Function) takes multiple FFTs over time to create a 3-dimensional colors plot which allows the user to visualize the shfting modes associated with the changing levels in a fuel tank.
